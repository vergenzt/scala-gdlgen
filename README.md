cardgamelib-scala
=================

This is a WIP Scala library to make it easy to implement playing card games
using a simple Scala DSL. I want to make it easy to encode the rules for a games
such as Uno or Spades or things like that, and hopefully make it easier to make
AI agents. :)

See the [examples](scard-api/src/main/scala/com/timvergenz/scard/examples)
package for what the DSL looks like.
