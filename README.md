scala-gdlgen
============

This is a WIP Scala framework to compile a Scala DSL into [Game Description Language](http://games.stanford.edu/games/gdl.html), allowing the expressiveness of Scala to simplify the process of creating a game, and hopefully increasing interest in [general game playing](http://www.ggp.org/).
